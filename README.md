## Background

Early cancer diagnosis and treatment play a crucial role in improving patients' survival rate. One of the most  important early diagnosis is to detect metastasis in lymph nodes through microscopic examination of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained histopathology slides.

## Dataset

PatchCamelyon (PCAM) benchmark dataset [[github](https://github.com/basveeling/pcam)].

It consists of 327.680 color images (96x96 px) extracted from histopathologic scans of lymph node sections. Each image is annotated with a binary label indicating presence of metastatic tissue.  

## Concepts

- **Whole slide imaging (WSI)**

  Refers to scanning of conventional glass slides in order to produce digital slides, is the most recent imaging modality being employed by pathology departments worldwide.
